    "    Important Instructions:\n",
    "    1. Only categorize a message if it explicitly states a difficulty, hardship, or challenge related to living in England as a Hong Kong person.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       - For example: \"I cannot afford...\", \"I am struggling to...\", \"I have difficulty...\", \"I face a barrier...\", or any clear complaint about a problem.\n",
    "       - Just mentioning a topic (like a driving test, theory test, housing, or healthcare) is NOT enough. Must explicitly describe a problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. If the message:\n",
    "       - is just sharing an event or promotional activity without mentioning any difficulty,\n",
    "       - is just a link (like a YouTube link),\n",
    "       - mentions political activity, theory tests, driving tests, education, or any other topic without explicitly stating a personal difficulty,\n",
    "       - is general discussion or random content without stating a personal challenge,\n",
    "    \n",
    "       then it MUST be categorized as \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. DO NOT GUESS a problem. If not clear, choose \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. If the message describes a specific difficulty, hardship, or challenge for living in England that is not covered by any of the existing main categories or their subcategories, you must introduce a new category or subcategory:\n",
    "    \n",
    "       - If the difficulty logically fits within an existing main category but none of its current subcategories capture this new aspect, add a new subcategory under that existing main category. This new subcategory should clearly describe the specific difficulty mentioned in the message.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       - If the difficulty does not fit under any existing main category at all, create a completely new main category and a relevant first subcategory. Both the main category and subcategory names must clearly reflect the nature of the newly mentioned difficulty.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Important:\n",
    "    - Do not reuse, copy, or refer to any categories or subcategories given as examples in these instructions. They are placeholders only.  \n",
    "    - Each time you create a new category or subcategory, invent a unique and contextually appropriate name that matches the difficulty described in the message.  \n",
    "    - The new category and/or subcategory must be directly related to the difficulty stated. If the message talks about a type of difficulty not previously covered, think of a descriptive name that conveys that exact challenge.\n",
    "    - After introducing a new category or subcategory, do not continue categorizing further messages in this batch. Stop immediately and return only the newly created category and subcategory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For clarity:\n",
    "    - If a message states a difficulty and it clearly doesn't match any existing categories or subcategories, you must come up with a new main category name and a new subcategory name that accurately describe this difficulty.  \n",
    "    - If a message states a difficulty that fits an existing category but needs a more specific angle not listed, add a new subcategory to that existing main category that directly addresses the difficulty mentioned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Do not guess or approximate. If the difficulty is new, create the category or subcategory right away. Do not return 'Uncategorized' when a difficulty is explicitly described and not covered by existing categories. Instead, produce a new category and/or subcategory as required.\n",
    "    5. No commentary or extra text outside the specified format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Format:**\n",
    "    <message_number>. <Main Category>\n",
    "        • <Subcategory>\n",

      "    Important Instructions:\n",
      "    1. Only categorize a message if it explicitly states a difficulty, hardship, or challenge related to living in England as a Hong Kong person.\n",
      "    \n",
      "       - For example: \"I cannot afford...\", \"I am struggling to...\", \"I have difficulty...\", \"I face a barrier...\", or any clear complaint about a problem.\n",
      "       - Just mentioning a topic (like a driving test, theory test, housing, or healthcare) is NOT enough. Must explicitly describe a problem.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    2. If the message:\n",
      "       - is just sharing an event or promotional activity without mentioning any difficulty,\n",
      "       - is just a link (like a YouTube link),\n",
      "       - mentions political activity, theory tests, driving tests, education, or any other topic without explicitly stating a personal difficulty,\n",
      "       - is general discussion or random content without stating a personal challenge,\n",
      "    \n",
      "       then it MUST be categorized as \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "    3. DO NOT GUESS a problem. If not clear, choose \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "    4. If the message describes a specific difficulty, hardship, or challenge for living in England that is not covered by any of the existing main categories or their subcategories, you must introduce a new category or subcategory:\n",
      "    \n",
      "       - If the difficulty logically fits within an existing main category but none of its current subcategories capture this new aspect, add a new subcategory under that existing main category. This new subcategory should clearly describe the specific difficulty mentioned in the message.\n",
      "       \n",
      "       - If the difficulty does not fit under any existing main category at all, create a completely new main category and a relevant first subcategory. Both the main category and subcategory names must clearly reflect the nature of the newly mentioned difficulty.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Important:\n",
      "    - Do not reuse, copy, or refer to any categories or subcategories given as examples in these instructions. They are placeholders only.  \n",
      "    - Each time you create a new category or subcategory, invent a unique and contextually appropriate name that matches the difficulty described in the message.  \n",
      "    - The new category and/or subcategory must be directly related to the difficulty stated. If the message talks about a type of difficulty not previously covered, think of a descriptive name that conveys that exact challenge.\n",
      "    - After introducing a new category or subcategory, do not continue categorizing further messages in this batch. Stop immediately and return only the newly created category and subcategory.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    For clarity:\n",
      "    - If a message states a difficulty and it clearly doesn't match any existing categories or subcategories, you must come up with a new main category name and a new subcategory name that accurately describe this difficulty.  \n",
      "    - If a message states a difficulty that fits an existing category but needs a more specific angle not listed, add a new subcategory to that existing main category that directly addresses the difficulty mentioned.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Do not guess or approximate. If the difficulty is new, create the category or subcategory right away. Do not return 'Uncategorized' when a difficulty is explicitly described and not covered by existing categories. Instead, produce a new category and/or subcategory as required.\n",
      "    5. No commentary or extra text outside the specified format.\n",

      "片段所見就係野外訓練其中最痛苦嘅環節之一’Ambush’。當你日頭已經操到死，好難得可以捐入睡袋休息一兩個鐘嘅時候，往往就會遭遇敵人襲擊要捐出都未訓暖嘅睡袋去還火。當做得唔好嘅時候仲要2分鐘pack好哂所有嘢模擬戰敗撤退，孭住40公斤裝備喺野外跑幾公里搵新嘅據點。槍林彈雨之下就同真係上咗戰場冇咩分別。\n",

      "    Important Instructions:\n",
      "    1. Only categorize a message if it explicitly states a difficulty, hardship, or challenge related to living in England as a Hong Kong person.\n",
      "    \n",
      "       - For example: \"I cannot afford...\", \"I am struggling to...\", \"I have difficulty...\", \"I face a barrier...\", or any clear complaint about a problem.\n",
      "       - Just mentioning a topic (like a driving test, theory test, housing, or healthcare) is NOT enough. Must explicitly describe a problem.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    2. If the message:\n",
      "       - is just sharing an event or promotional activity without mentioning any difficulty,\n",
      "       - is just a link (like a YouTube link),\n",
      "       - mentions political activity, theory tests, driving tests, education, or any other topic without explicitly stating a personal difficulty,\n",
      "       - is general discussion or random content without stating a personal challenge,\n",
      "    \n",
      "       then it MUST be categorized as \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "    3. DO NOT GUESS a problem. If not clear, choose \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "    4. If the message describes a specific difficulty, hardship, or challenge for living in England that is not covered by any of the existing main categories or their subcategories, you must introduce a new category or subcategory:\n",
      "    \n",
      "       - If the difficulty logically fits within an existing main category but none of its current subcategories capture this new aspect, add a new subcategory under that existing main category. This new subcategory should clearly describe the specific difficulty mentioned in the message.\n",
      "       \n",
      "       - If the difficulty does not fit under any existing main category at all, create a completely new main category and a relevant first subcategory. Both the main category and subcategory names must clearly reflect the nature of the newly mentioned difficulty.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Important:\n",
      "    - Do not reuse, copy, or refer to any categories or subcategories given as examples in these instructions. They are placeholders only.  \n",
      "    - Each time you create a new category or subcategory, invent a unique and contextually appropriate name that matches the difficulty described in the message.  \n",
      "    - The new category and/or subcategory must be directly related to the difficulty stated. If the message talks about a type of difficulty not previously covered, think of a descriptive name that conveys that exact challenge.\n",
      "    - After introducing a new category or subcategory, do not continue categorizing further messages in this batch. Stop immediately and return only the newly created category and subcategory.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    For clarity:\n",
      "    - If a message states a difficulty and it clearly doesn't match any existing categories or subcategories, you must come up with a new main category name and a new subcategory name that accurately describe this difficulty.  \n",
      "    - If a message states a difficulty that fits an existing category but needs a more specific angle not listed, add a new subcategory to that existing main category that directly addresses the difficulty mentioned.\n",
      "    \n",
