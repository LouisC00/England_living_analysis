    "    Important Instructions:\n",
    "    1. Only categorize a message if it explicitly states a difficulty, hardship, or challenge related to living in England as a Hong Kong person.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       - For example: \"I cannot afford...\", \"I am struggling to...\", \"I have difficulty...\", \"I face a barrier...\", or any clear complaint about a problem.\n",
    "       - Just mentioning a topic (like a driving test, theory test, housing, or healthcare) is NOT enough. Must explicitly describe a problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. If the message:\n",
    "       - is just sharing an event or promotional activity without mentioning any difficulty,\n",
    "       - is just a link (like a YouTube link),\n",
    "       - mentions political activity, theory tests, driving tests, education, or any other topic without explicitly stating a personal difficulty,\n",
    "       - is general discussion or random content without stating a personal challenge,\n",
    "    \n",
    "       then it MUST be categorized as \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. DO NOT GUESS a problem. If not clear, choose \"Uncategorized.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. If the message describes a specific difficulty, hardship, or challenge for living in England that is not covered by any of the existing main categories or their subcategories, you must introduce a new category or subcategory:\n",
    "    \n",
    "       - If the difficulty logically fits within an existing main category but none of its current subcategories capture this new aspect, add a new subcategory under that existing main category. This new subcategory should clearly describe the specific difficulty mentioned in the message.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       - If the difficulty does not fit under any existing main category at all, create a completely new main category and a relevant first subcategory. Both the main category and subcategory names must clearly reflect the nature of the newly mentioned difficulty.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Important:\n",
    "    - Do not reuse, copy, or refer to any categories or subcategories given as examples in these instructions. They are placeholders only.  \n",
    "    - Each time you create a new category or subcategory, invent a unique and contextually appropriate name that matches the difficulty described in the message.  \n",
    "    - The new category and/or subcategory must be directly related to the difficulty stated. If the message talks about a type of difficulty not previously covered, think of a descriptive name that conveys that exact challenge.\n",
    "    - After introducing a new category or subcategory, do not continue categorizing further messages in this batch. Stop immediately and return only the newly created category and subcategory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For clarity:\n",
    "    - If a message states a difficulty and it clearly doesn't match any existing categories or subcategories, you must come up with a new main category name and a new subcategory name that accurately describe this difficulty.  \n",
    "    - If a message states a difficulty that fits an existing category but needs a more specific angle not listed, add a new subcategory to that existing main category that directly addresses the difficulty mentioned.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Do not guess or approximate. If the difficulty is new, create the category or subcategory right away. Do not return 'Uncategorized' when a difficulty is explicitly described and not covered by existing categories. Instead, produce a new category and/or subcategory as required.\n",
    "    5. No commentary or extra text outside the specified format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Format:**\n",
    "    <message_number>. <Main Category>\n",
    "        • <Subcategory>\n",

User Mn55245 asked for a lawyer recommendation, expressing a need for legal assistance or advocacy services. User kevinlaw1984 complained about a bureaucratic issue relating to tax and mentioned having to submit additional documentation. It shows a concern about understanding tax obligations and filing necessary documentation.\\n\\n2. **Personal Care and Appearance:** Three users brought up issues related to personal care and appearance, particularly about finding good quality hair salon services. User nan first asked about condition of hair salons in Chinatown and then asked for recommendations for Hong Kong hair stylists in the city center of Manchester. HKIndependenxe added to the discussion by sharing a negative review about a hair salon, demonstrating the concern about quality.\\n\\n3. **Social and Cultural Adjustment**: User nan proposed building a community by uniting with others who are also new to Manchester, aiming to build social connections and overcome feelings of isolation.\\n\\n4. **Employment and Economic Opportunities**: User speakandmove's message covers a complex subcategory about the difficulty of job-related training, specifically military training. The user shared a specific military experience wanting to understand the resilience building procedure against strenuous physical activity.\\n\\n5. **Economic and Financial Stability**: An insight on economic changes was highlighted by Produnkcan, who posted about a predicted drop in interest rates in the UK, indicating the importance of adapting to market fluctuations and economic changes.\\n\\nGeneralisation:\\n\\nThe primary categories discussed included Legal and Bureaucratic Challenges, Personal Care and Appearance, Social and Cultural Adjustment, Employment and Economic Opportunities, and Economic and Financial Stability.\\n\\nParticularly, in 'Legal and Bureaucratic Challenges', the two users concerned about legal assistance and understanding tax obligations. In 'Personal Care and Appearance', the three users focused on finding quality hair salon services. One user expressed a desire for 'Social and Cultural Adjustment' in their new living environment. A single user talked about their experience in the subcategory of Employment and Economic Opportunities, and one user touched upon Economic and Financial Stability with a specific concern for adapting to economic changes. It can be observed that while these users expressed their own unique set of concerns, they also shared common issues about living in a new environment.\"},\n",

Employment and Economic Opportunities: User 'HKIndependenxe' (message 16) is looking for job opportunities in IT/cybersecurity. This indicates an ongoing search to integrate into the job market and network within a specific professional community.\\n\\n4. Healthcare and Well-Being: User 'nan' in message 19 offers nail care on-the-go in the Birmingham city center. This message emphasizes the importance of personal care and availability of such services for overall well-being. \\n\\n5. Transportation and Mobility: Users 'hk1842' (message 14) and 'burnwithus2019' along with 'tthhooj' (messages 17 and 18 respectively) discuss driving licences and road challenges in Hong Kong.
